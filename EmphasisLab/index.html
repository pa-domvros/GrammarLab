            { title: 'Emphatic "Do/Does/Did"', standard: 'He paid for the tickets.', emphatic: 'He did pay for the tickets!', explanation: 'Adding "do/does/did" to a positive statement adds strong emphasis, often to contradict, confirm, or insist on a fact.' }

            { title: 'Inversion (Negative)', standard: "I have rarely seen such a dedicated student.", suggested: "Rarely have I seen such a dedicated student.", explanation: "Starting with the negative adverbial 'Rarely' requires inverting the subject 'I' and the auxiliary verb 'have'." },
            { title: 'Inversion (Only + ...)', standard: "We can achieve success only by working together.", suggested: "Only by working together can we achieve success.", explanation: "When the 'Only by...' phrase moves to the front, the main clause inverts the subject 'we' and the modal verb 'can'." },
            { title: 'It-Cleft (Emphasize Agent)', standard: "The manager made the final decision.", suggested: "It was the manager who made the final decision.", explanation: "To emphasize 'the manager', we use the structure 'It was [agent] who...'" },
            { title: 'Wh-Cleft (Emphasize Action)', standard: "She wants to travel the world.", suggested: "What she wants to do is travel the world.", explanation: "To emphasize the action 'to travel', we use a 'what-clause' as the subject of the sentence." },
            { title: 'Inversion (Conditional)', standard: "If you were to win the lottery, what would you do?", suggested: "Were you to win the lottery, what would you do?", explanation: "In this formal conditional, 'if' is omitted and the subject 'you' and verb 'were' are inverted." },
            { title: 'Fronting (Object)', standard: "I will not tolerate that kind of behavior.", suggested: "That kind of behavior, I will not tolerate.", explanation: "The object 'That kind of behavior' is moved to the front for emphasis, without changing the subject-verb order." },
            { title: 'Emphatic "Did"', standard: "I told you to clean your room.", suggested: "I did tell you to clean your room!", explanation: "The emphatic 'did' is added to insist that the action happened, often in response to doubt or contradiction." },
            { title: 'Inversion (No sooner)', standard: "He had no sooner finished his dinner than he fell asleep.", suggested: "No sooner had he finished his dinner than he fell asleep.", explanation: "The phrase 'No sooner' at the beginning triggers the inversion of the subject 'he' and the auxiliary verb 'had'." },
            { title: 'It-Cleft (Emphasize Time)', standard: "The package arrived yesterday.", suggested: "It was yesterday that the package arrived.", explanation: "To emphasize 'yesterday', we use the structure 'It was [time] that...'" },
            { title: 'Fronting (Locative)', standard: "The king's carriage rolled down the hill.", suggested: "Down the hill rolled the king's carriage.", explanation: "When the phrase of place 'Down the hill' is fronted, the verb 'rolled' and the subject 'the king's carriage' are inverted for a more dramatic effect." }
