            { situation: "You didn't study for the test, so you failed. Express your regret.", answer: "If I had studied for the test, I would have passed.", explanation: "Third conditional is used to express regrets about the past." },
            { situation: "Your friend wants to buy an expensive phone but can't afford it. Give them advice.", answer: "If I were you, I would save my money.", explanation: "Second conditional is used to give hypothetical advice." },
            { situation: "You are planning a picnic for tomorrow. The weather forecast is uncertain. Talk about your plan.", answer: "If it is sunny tomorrow, we will have a picnic.", explanation: "First conditional is used for real future possibilities." },
            { situation: "Explain a basic scientific fact about ice.", answer: "If you heat ice, it melts.", explanation: "Zero conditional is used for general truths and scientific facts." },
            { situation: "You didn't take that job offer years ago. Now, you are not happy with your career. Connect the past decision to the present reality.", answer: "If I had taken that job, I would be happier now.", explanation: "Mixed conditional (Past -> Present) connects a past hypothetical action to a present result." },

Connect your present ability to a past event.", answer: "If I were a faster runner, I would have won the race yesterday.", explanation: "Mixed conditional (Present -> Past) connects a present hypothetical state to a past result." },
            { situation: "You will go to the concert, but only if you can get a front-row ticket. State your condition.", answer: "I will go to the concert provided that I get a front-row ticket.", explanation: "'Provided that' is a formal alternative to 'if' for stating a firm condition." },
            { situation: "You will not help your friend with his project because he never helps you. State the negative condition.", answer: "I won't help you with your project unless you help me with mine.", explanation: "'Unless' is used to mean 'except if'." },
            { situation: "Your friend is asking for your opinion on a jacket. You think it looks good. Give your opinion.", answer: "If I were you, I would buy it.", explanation: "Second conditional is a common and polite way to give advice or an opinion." },
            { situation: "You missed the bus this morning because you woke up late. Express this past regret.", answer: "If I hadn't woken up late, I wouldn't have missed the bus.", explanation: "Third conditional is used for hypothetical past situations and their outcomes." },
            { situation: "You might need help later. Formally ask a colleague to be available.", answer: "Should you have a moment later, I'd appreciate your help.", explanation: "Formal inversion ('Should you...') is an elegant way to state a future possibility without using 'if'." },
            { situation: "You are not the president, so you cannot change the law. Express this hypothetical reality.", answer: "If I were the president, I would change the law.", explanation: "Second conditional describes an unreal situation in the present." },
            { situation: "You want to go to the beach this weekend, but it depends on the car being available. Express this future plan.", answer: "If the car is available, we will go to the beach this weekend.", explanation: "First conditional is for real possibilities in the future." },
            { situation: "You are giving a friend permission to use your laptop, with one condition: they must be careful.", answer: "You can use my laptop as long as you are careful.", explanation: "'As long as' is an alternative to 'if' that sets a continuous condition." },
            { situation: "You are thinking about a past mistake. You didn't invest in a company, and now it's very successful. Express your regret.", answer: "Had I invested in that company, I would be a millionaire now.", explanation: "Formal inversion ('Had I...') combined with a mixed conditional (Past -> Present) for a sophisticated expression of regret." },
            { situation: "Explain the rule for a particular game: when a player lands on a certain square, they miss a turn.", answer: "If a player lands on this square, they miss a turn.", explanation: "Zero conditional is used for rules and instructions that are always true." },

Because of this, you didn't enjoy your trip to Spain last year.", answer: "If I were fluent in Spanish, I would have enjoyed my trip more.", explanation: "Mixed conditional (Present -> Past) connects a present hypothetical state to a past result." },
            { situation: "You are taking a map with you on a hike. Explain why.", answer: "I'm taking a map in case we get lost.", explanation: "'In case' is used to talk about precautions for a possible future event." },
            { situation: "Your friend is sick. You are not a doctor, so you can't help much. Express this hypothetical situation.", answer: "If I were a doctor, I would know what to do.", explanation: "Second conditional is used for unreal present situations." },

Express this past situation formally.", answer: "Had I known you were in the hospital, I would have visited.", explanation: "Formal inversion ('Had I...') is an elegant way to express a past hypothetical situation (Third Conditional)." }
